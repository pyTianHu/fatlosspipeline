Fatloss pipeline and visualization
This is the first time I'm going through this data from analysis perspective. Even though I've been collecting this data for a couple of years now, I've never worried about data quality, neither did i think of ever going to make analysis on it.
Hence, what you see in this pipeline is my very first take starting from ingestion, throughout profiling, identifying quality issues, trying to correct them, identifying valuable data that can later serve basis of important metrics in finding correlations, causations, and visualizing these.
I have hardly made any backward changes in the pipeline, as my intention here was to have a raw process on exploring this data, and later refine and optimize it as a proper data pipeline.
